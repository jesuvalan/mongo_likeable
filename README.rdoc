= mongo_likeable

Works for both Mongoid and Mongo_Mapper!

== Installation

In console:
  gem install mongo_likeable
or in Gemfile:
  gem 'mongo_likeable'

== Usage

To make model likeable you need to include Mongo::Likeable into your document:

  class User
    include Mongoid::Document  #for Mongo_Mapper users, this line of code should be include MongoMapper::Document
    include Mongo::Likeable
  end

After this,

  u = User.new
  u.like?(some_stuff)

  u.like(some_stuff) # make sure you do this check before like/dislike
                     # cuz like and dislike the same thing at the same time seems strange
  u.like(*some_array_of_stuffs) # like an array of stuffs

  u.dislike(some_other_stuff)

  u.clear_likes() # if no parameter is given, all likes will be cleared.
  u.clear_likes(s, s1, s2...)

  u.like_counts # display total counts
  u.dislike_counts
